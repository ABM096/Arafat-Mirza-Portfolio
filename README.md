# Hi, I'm Arafat Baig Mirza

I’m a Data & Business Analyst with a strong interest in understanding how data shapes decisions.  
I recently completed my Master’s in Business Analytics, and this portfolio highlights the projects I’ve built while developing my skills in data analysis, visualization, and problem-solving.

What motivates me most is taking a messy dataset, making sense of it, and turning it into something useful whether that’s a dashboard, a clear explanation, or a recommendation that can improve outcomes. Every project here reflects that mindset.

## What this portfolio includes

This repository brings together the work I’ve done across **Data Analytics**, **Business Analysis**, and **Financial Analytics**.  
Each project is built end-to-end and typically includes:

- Real datasets  
- Data cleaning and preparation  
- Power BI dashboards and KPIs  
- SQL or DAX calculations  
- Clear insights and takeaways  
- Practical recommendations  

I aim to make each project feel realistic and connected to how analytics is used in actual business environments.
